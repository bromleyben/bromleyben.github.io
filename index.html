        <p>Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my attitude towards life. I’m beginning to notice that allow far to much to<br>simply… happen. I just allow myself to be present in situations where others make decisions around me<br>to which I can follow, but rarely do I ever initiate anything. Passivity, that’s what it is, I have been<br>so very passive for a very long time, probably my whole life. It may just be part of my nature, but I can<br>see the damage of neglect that my passivity causes. I am afraid that I will let my life slip into pathways<br>that I don’t really want to be on, just because I never made a real push into anything, I just let life happen.<br>Have I believed that this is the way God wants me to live? That this is somehow trusting his course? Maybe it is,<br>but it’s on a scale that goes deeper than just allowing the shape of my life to be molded by God. Even in the<br>everyday I almost never raise my hand to suggest what we will do, where we will go. I just ride the flow, whether<br>I like it or not. Whilst I feel tired from working, studying and not sleeping enough, I feel even more restless to<br>move beyond these excuses for inaction.</p>
<p>I want to start striving towards goals, to see good plans take shape in real form. Enough idle dreaming, I want<br>these dreams of mine to materialize and nourish my soul and the souls of those around me. I want to be used by God<br>to achieve things of purpose, to touch lives and make impact. My inner life has felt like greyscale, with the barest<br>flecks of color that I try to sprinkle on from meaningless sources. I want to be filled with the vibrancy of real living, taking in the fruits of truth and beauty to grow into a man of rich character, not merely a satisfactory one.<br>This will mean dropping off a lot of mindsets and habits I have been developing my entire life, so be it.</p>

        <p>I don’t really know what to write. It’s been a while since I’ve even tried to think deeply. I finished reading Steven Lawheads ‘Pendragon Cycle’, a five part historical fantasy series. I found it really enjoyable. There is something unusual about it, as it really doesn’t follow a lot of the cliches of many fanatasy books. For one, it follows a long span of time, well over a hundred years. Many of the Characters come and go in that time, but there is a select race that has possess a much longer life span, allowing them to exist over the course of the entire series. It’s a story of grand scale, encompassing the fate and events of the isle of Britan and beyond. Lawhead seems to have a passion for something like the Sage’s arts, as many of his books feature prominent Bards, soothsayers or some other wizard-like figure who play the key role in the progression of the story. Merlin is the chief character in the Pendragon Cycle, though there is also Taliesin in the first book, Merlins father. The themes are rich and the story has many facets that are neither predictable nor too far from the classic tales of Arthur and his knights. </p>
<p>Anyways, I will have to write an actual review of it one day, once I have read it through a second time. There is something about fantasy books, and other fiction, that really inspires me. The raw portayals of honour, loyalty and vitue in Lawheads books give me a sense of what I am missing… That the current age is lacking these values that shine so brightly and so boldly. But of course I know the past was probably no more virtuous than the present, so perhaps it is just the portrayal that gives me a glimps of something more. But regardless of that, I want to figure out what it is in me that is drawn to these stories and characters and see if there isn’t some way I can help that desire grow into outward expression.</p>

        <p>I want to find purpose in the everyday. It seems strange and kind of wrong to me that “the everyday” is so synonymous<br> with the mundane and pointless. I know I must not be naive, life happens and must be managed. Food and beds must be<br> made, taxes must be paid, money must be earned. But God cannot have meant for that to be all we are worth, and that<br> a few hours some evenings or weekends will have to do for pursuing dreams and purpose. I suppose the ideal is that<br> our work is our passion. That way we can spend every day doing the things that fill us with purpose. I suspect this<br> is fairly rare. Most people aren’t interested in paying for your dreams to come true. I don’t dislike the work I do,<br> but there certainly are times when I feel I would find more satisfaction elsewhere…</p>
<p>Whether it’s through a healthy routine, or better self discipline, I want to make my everyday meaningful. Perhaps<br>it’s just through the nabbing of pieces of purpose in between the necessary, or sharing in the mundane with someone<br>else to make it a time to connect. My introversion keeps me somewhat hesitant to include people in these parts of my<br>life, but I need to get over that and start opening the door for deeper connections through the common day.</p>
