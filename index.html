        <p>After high school, after uni, with the start of every new year there comes a time to plan the steps ahead. I am in one such season now, I have been for a while. I finished the last of my uni several months ago now, and graduated two weeks ago. The driving force of formal education is gone, a wide valley of choice opens before me, vast and indimidating. </p>
<p>It feels like I have been travelling upon a trail through the woods, a trail that until this point has been dotted with signs and waypoints. But I suddenly find myself stepping out into the open air, standing at the edge of a clearing that ranges beyond the edge of sight. There are mountains on the horizon, though I know not how to get there. </p>
<p>I think I have been camping at the edge of that wood for the past few months. I don’t think this is such a bad thing, but I know sooner or later I will need to leave the comfort of the shade to seek out more furtile pastures. I suppose it is something like a quarter-life crisis, a transition of great significance. I am thinking a lot about what my next steps should be, what my aims should be and how I can expect to meet them. </p>
<p>Being a pretty passive person this is incredibly hard, I find it all to easy to just be flexible and “go with the flow”. Now that I have stepped out onto the bank, I have to choose which way to walk.</p>
<p>A number of key figures come to mind when considering this future, in no particular order they resemble:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out what work I am going to do longer term.</li>
<li>Finding my role in the church, or within missions.</li>
<li>Learning how best to lead and love my little family.</li>
<li>Deciding what skills or knowledge I am going to pursue now that my studies are complete.</li>
<li>Seeking out relationships that I can sow into and be nourished from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exploring these things are my chief goal for the next few months. Lets see how it goes.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>I often find myself battling the feeling of being overwhealmed by the sheer number of decisions to be made and expectations to be met.<br>Questions like bees fill my mind all waking hours: should I do this or that? Where should my life be heading? Am I doing enough? Most of the time I can supress the rising anxiety by numbing it with media or other distractions, but sometimes it threatens to steal my breath. I have to breathe slowly and try to quiet the noise that is growing in my mind. </p>
<p>I have always struggled with something like this, in one form or another. When I was a child it was the incessant fear that my mother would die, a crippling anxiety that left me unable to go to school some days and always accompanied a lingering nausea. In my teen years it morphed into an inability to rest, always feeling like I ought to be doing more to make something of myself. I loved to play video games, but they left me feeling dissapointed with myself and how I was waisting my time. Perhaps this was good, but it tore me up inside and prevented me from finding much respite from the intense sense of obligation I had to live up to my imagined potential. I deeply enjoyed escaping reality by entering the imaginary worlds of Highrule, Middle Earth and the wide expanses of science fiction, but the lingering guilt of my neglect of the real world soured my enjoyment. It was an inner conflict that felt both serious and pathetically childish at the same time.</p>
<p>This internal conflict between the real and unreal world has followed me all my days, and whilst the demands of adult life have largely sobered me, the draw towards the fantastical and imaginary visits me often. Nowadays movies such as those by Studio Ghibli, books like those of Steven Lawhead and the music of Yiruma and Howard Shore all reignite the longing in me for something that transcends the world I see and feel around me. But I digress.</p>
<p>In year 8 I fell in love. I was head over heels in love with Nancy Bruce, a cheeky and fun girl in the year below. Ours was not very different to your average teen romance. It had its share of dramas and falling ins and outs of love and whatnot. However, I was a very dedicated chap, and despite some serious opposition to the match on the part of her parents I was determined to see the relationship come to fruition. I knew I had found someone special, and I had no intention of letting a few years of waiting take her away from me. The side effect of this was that I now had something to lose, a person I cared about deeply. This did serve to pull me out of some of my reality escaping ways for a time, but it also gave me a new source of anxiety.</p>
<p>For years I obsessed over the vital signs of our relationship, and the monitoring of my own feelings towards it. I was always on the lookout for potential dangers, signs that our feelings for one another were flagging. It was at this stage that I even began to question myself in terms of compitence and maturity, something I had felt no need to consider before having someone to impress. But even impressing, I desired a sense of self assurance that I was going to be capable and mature enough to be a good boyfriend, and future spouse (yes this was on my mind at the age of 15). And thus the lingering anxiety of my life found its way in between the cracks and gnawed at my joy.</p>
<p>After high school, things got a little easier, and a little harder. We were allowed to be seeing one another, so the anxiety that comes from uneasy meetings and stolen moments was gone, though a new fear began to creep in. Once you have something that you truly value, the fear of losing it can be all but ovewhealming. And so I lived with an intense stress in my heart that Nancy would, for one reason or another, lose her love for me. This fear seemed to also manifest itself in something of a paranoia, where activities such as drinking and partying were a constant worry when I though of Nancy being involved in them. I don’t really know why this affected me so, but I think it may have been a fear of her going down a path I could not follow, or that would make her no longer attracted to me. I know now how much mental effort I wasted in these useless anxieties, but there is nothing I can do to change it now. </p>
<p>After a trip to Bolivia, where I stuggle more intensly with anxiety than any other time in my life, something seemed to resolve itself in me. The amount I prayed whilst over there must have made a difference, since after that trip the anxiety about Nancy completely fled from me. It was an incredible feeling to be relieved from the terrible burden of such oppressive stress in my heart. I am so incredibly greatful to this day to God for rescuing me from that anxiety, I do not think I could have lived with it long. </p>
<p>Even so, old demons die hard, and anxiety gradually found another angle of attack, even if it was less personal. Half a year out of high school I started a degree in electrical engineering. Why I chose this, I am not completely sure, but I soon began to suspect that I had made a mistake. I have never been a lover of maths, and whilst I am able to do it ok, I find it very tedious and unfulfilling. Little had I realised that a Electrical Engineering has some of the highest levels of maths in any degree, one step down from a full on mathematics degree. As the months wore on I grew increasingly worried that I was getting myself into a career I was going to hate. I was spending almost every hour of every day pouring through mathematical operations, electrical diagrams and technical manuals. Some of it was interesting, I enjoyed the hands on elements, but the maths was killing me. I just didn’t like it at all. I started to panic from time to time. I would subtly cry on the train to uni when I thought about my whole life becoming just a routine of maths and circuit diagrams. I had constant headaches and couldn’t sleep well at night as the equations filled my overtired mind. By some miracle I was able to hold on to Nancy (or maybe she was holding on to me), even when I felt like I was slowly losing my marbles. We got engaged, and leading up to our wedding I resolved to make a change. I was not going to let Nancy live with a miserable basket case for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Of all the classes I had done at uni, the only one I actually enjoyed was C programming. Programming made sense to me, it was just a language for speaking with technology. Since I could carry over all my credit points, and still stay within the engineering degree, I moved to ICT (Information Communication Technology) engineering, Majoring in Software. Whilst it certainly wasn’t a walk in the park, and I stil had a few maths subjects to get through, I felt an immediate change within myself. This was something I could do, and it was actually kind of fun.</p>
<p>From then on the struggle has certainly been muted. I am not often struck with the same sense of constricting anxiety, the kind that is all consuming and cripples my mind. It comes and goes now like weeds trying to infiltrate by heart, that if I don’t spend enough time pulling them out can begin to wear down at me. I now find myself trying not to worry about such typical things, finances, my job, whether I am being a good husband or father, whether I am following the path God wants me to be on. It is a joy to me that I have completed my studies, they were becoming quite a burden in the end, forcing me to spend my evenings completing assignments on subjects I cared nothing about. Now there is some room at least to breathe and dream, to spend unborrowed time with my darling ones and enjoy exploring other avenues of life. </p>
<p>Overall I am the most content now that I have ever been. God has richly blessed me with so much, a loving wife &amp; daughter, friends &amp; family, a home, a church family, a good job, perfect health, the list goes on. Though I continue to pray and seek for help with this thorn in my side, the tendancy to find myself anxious and battling feelings of being overwhelmed, I am also able to cope with much more than I ever have before. The levels of responsibility I find myself facing lead me to new concerns, new challenges, but I know that even just a few years ago I would never have been able to face them the way I can now. </p>

        <p>Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my attitude towards life. I’m beginning to notice that allow far to much to<br>simply… happen. I just allow myself to be present in situations where others make decisions around me<br>to which I can follow, but rarely do I ever initiate anything. Passivity, that’s what it is, I have been<br>so very passive for a very long time, probably my whole life. It may just be part of my nature, but I can<br>see the damage of neglect that my passivity causes. I am afraid that I will let my life slip into pathways<br>that I don’t really want to be on, just because I never made a real push into anything, I just let life happen.<br>Have I believed that this is the way God wants me to live? That this is somehow trusting his course? Maybe it is,<br>but it’s on a scale that goes deeper than just allowing the shape of my life to be molded by God. Even in the<br>everyday I almost never raise my hand to suggest what we will do, where we will go. I just ride the flow, whether<br>I like it or not. Whilst I feel tired from working, studying and not sleeping enough, I feel even more restless to<br>move beyond these excuses for inaction.</p>
<p>I want to start striving towards goals, to see good plans take shape in real form. Enough idle dreaming, I want<br>these dreams of mine to materialize and nourish my soul and the souls of those around me. I want to be used by God<br>to achieve things of purpose, to touch lives and make impact. My inner life has felt like greyscale, with the barest<br>flecks of color that I try to sprinkle on from meaningless sources. I want to be filled with the vibrancy of real living, taking in the fruits of truth and beauty to grow into a man of rich character, not merely a satisfactory one.<br>This will mean dropping off a lot of mindsets and habits I have been developing my entire life, so be it.</p>

        <p>I don’t really know what to write. It’s been a while since I’ve even tried to think deeply. I finished reading Steven Lawheads ‘Pendragon Cycle’, a five part historical fantasy series. I found it really enjoyable. There is something unusual about it, as it really doesn’t follow a lot of the cliches of many fanatasy books. For one, it follows a long span of time, well over a hundred years. Many of the Characters come and go in that time, but there is a select race that has possess a much longer life span, allowing them to exist over the course of the entire series. It’s a story of grand scale, encompassing the fate and events of the isle of Britan and beyond. Lawhead seems to have a passion for something like the Sage’s arts, as many of his books feature prominent Bards, soothsayers or some other wizard-like figure who play the key role in the progression of the story. Merlin is the chief character in the Pendragon Cycle, though there is also Taliesin in the first book, Merlins father. The themes are rich and the story has many facets that are neither predictable nor too far from the classic tales of Arthur and his knights. </p>
<p>Anyways, I will have to write an actual review of it one day, once I have read it through a second time. There is something about fantasy books, and other fiction, that really inspires me. The raw portayals of honour, loyalty and vitue in Lawheads books give me a sense of what I am missing… That the current age is lacking these values that shine so brightly and so boldly. But of course I know the past was probably no more virtuous than the present, so perhaps it is just the portrayal that gives me a glimps of something more. But regardless of that, I want to figure out what it is in me that is drawn to these stories and characters and see if there isn’t some way I can help that desire grow into outward expression.</p>

        <p>I want to find purpose in the everyday. It seems strange and kind of wrong to me that “the everyday” is so synonymous<br> with the mundane and pointless. I know I must not be naive, life happens and must be managed. Food and beds must be<br> made, taxes must be paid, money must be earned. But God cannot have meant for that to be all we are worth, and that<br> a few hours some evenings or weekends will have to do for pursuing dreams and purpose. I suppose the ideal is that<br> our work is our passion. That way we can spend every day doing the things that fill us with purpose. I suspect this<br> is fairly rare. Most people aren’t interested in paying for your dreams to come true. I don’t dislike the work I do,<br> but there certainly are times when I feel I would find more satisfaction elsewhere…</p>
<p>Whether it’s through a healthy routine, or better self discipline, I want to make my everyday meaningful. Perhaps<br>it’s just through the nabbing of pieces of purpose in between the necessary, or sharing in the mundane with someone<br>else to make it a time to connect. My introversion keeps me somewhat hesitant to include people in these parts of my<br>life, but I need to get over that and start opening the door for deeper connections through the common day.</p>
