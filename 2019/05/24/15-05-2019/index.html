        <p>I often find myself battling the feeling of being overwhealmed by the sheer number of decisions to be made and expectations to be met.<br>Questions like bees fill my mind all waking hours: should I do this or that? Where should my life be heading? Am I doing enough? Most of the time I can supress the rising anxiety by numbing it with media or other distractions, but sometimes it threatens to steal my breath. I have to breathe slowly and try to quiet the noise that is growing in my mind. </p>
<p>I have always struggled with something like this, in one form or another. When I was a child it was the incessant fear that my mother would die, a crippling anxiety that left me unable to go to school some days and always accompanied a lingering nausea. In my teen years it morphed into an inability to rest, always feeling like I ought to be doing more to make something of myself. I loved to play video games, but they left me feeling dissapointed with myself and how I was waisting my time. Perhaps this was good, but it tore me up inside and prevented me from finding much respite from the intense sense of obligation I had to live up to my imagined potential. I deeply enjoyed escaping reality by entering the imaginary worlds of Highrule, Middle Earth and the wide expanses of science fiction, but the lingering guilt of my neglect of the real world soured my enjoyment. It was an inner conflict that felt both serious and pathetically childish at the same time.</p>
<p>This internal conflict between the real and unreal world has followed me all my days, and whilst the demands of adult life have largely sobered me, the draw towards the fantastical and imaginary visits me often. Nowadays movies such as those by Studio Ghibli, books like those of Steven Lawhead and the music of Yiruma and Howard Shore all reignite the longing in me for something that transcends the world I see and feel around me. But I digress.</p>
<p>In year 8 I fell in love. I was head over heels in love with Nancy Bruce, a cheeky and fun girl in the year below. Ours was not very different to your average teen romance. It had its share of dramas and falling ins and outs of love and whatnot. However, I was a very dedicated chap, and despite some serious opposition to the match on the part of her parents I was determined to see the relationship come to fruition. I knew I had found someone special, and I had no intention of letting a few years of waiting take her away from me. The side effect of this was that I now had something to lose, a person I cared about deeply. This did serve to pull me out of some of my reality escaping ways for a time, but it also gave me a new source of anxiety.</p>
<p>For years I obsessed over the vital signs of our relationship, and the monitoring of my own feelings towards it. I was always on the lookout for potential dangers, signs that our feelings for one another were flagging. It was at this stage that I even began to question myself in terms of compitence and maturity, something I had felt no need to consider before having someone to impress. But even impressing, I desired a sense of self assurance that I was going to be capable and mature enough to be a good boyfriend, and future spouse (yes this was on my mind at the age of 15). And thus the lingering anxiety of my life found its way in between the cracks and gnawed at my joy.</p>
<p>After high school, things got a little easier, and a little harder. We were allowed to be seeing one another, so the anxiety that comes from uneasy meetings and stolen moments was gone, though a new fear began to creep in. Once you have something that you truly value, the fear of losing it can be all but ovewhealming. And so I lived with an intense stress in my heart that Nancy would, for one reason or another, lose her love for me. This fear seemed to also manifest itself in something of a paranoia, where activities such as drinking and partying were a constant worry when I though of Nancy being involved in them. I don’t really know why this affected me so, but I think it may have been a fear of her going down a path I could not follow, or that would make her no longer attracted to me. I know now how much mental effort I wasted in these useless anxieties, but there is nothing I can do to change it now. </p>
<p>After a trip to Bolivia, where I stuggle more intensly with anxiety than any other time in my life, something seemed to resolve itself in me. The amount I prayed whilst over there must have made a difference, since after that trip the anxiety about Nancy completely fled from me. It was an incredible feeling to be relieved from the terrible burden of such oppressive stress in my heart. I am so incredibly greatful to this day to God for rescuing me from that anxiety, I do not think I could have lived with it long. </p>
<p>Even so, old demons die hard, and anxiety gradually found another angle of attack, even if it was less personal. Half a year out of high school I started a degree in electrical engineering. Why I chose this, I am not completely sure, but I soon began to suspect that I had made a mistake. I have never been a lover of maths, and whilst I am able to do it ok, I find it very tedious and unfulfilling. Little had I realised that a Electrical Engineering has some of the highest levels of maths in any degree, one step down from a full on mathematics degree. As the months wore on I grew increasingly worried that I was getting myself into a career I was going to hate. I was spending almost every hour of every day pouring through mathematical operations, electrical diagrams and technical manuals. Some of it was interesting, I enjoyed the hands on elements, but the maths was killing me. I just didn’t like it at all. I started to panic from time to time. I would subtly cry on the train to uni when I thought about my whole life becoming just a routine of maths and circuit diagrams. I had constant headaches and couldn’t sleep well at night as the equations filled my overtired mind. By some miracle I was able to hold on to Nancy (or maybe she was holding on to me), even when I felt like I was slowly losing my marbles. We got engaged, and leading up to our wedding I resolved to make a change. I was not going to let Nancy live with a miserable basket case for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>Of all the classes I had done at uni, the only one I actually enjoyed was C programming. Programming made sense to me, it was just a language for speaking with technology. Since I could carry over all my credit points, and still stay within the engineering degree, I moved to ICT (Information Communication Technology) engineering, Majoring in Software. Whilst it certainly wasn’t a walk in the park, and I stil had a few maths subjects to get through, I felt an immediate change within myself. This was something I could do, and it was actually kind of fun.</p>
<p>From then on the struggle has certainly been muted. I am not often struck with the same sense of constricting anxiety, the kind that is all consuming and cripples my mind. It comes and goes now like weeds trying to infiltrate by heart, that if I don’t spend enough time pulling them out can begin to wear down at me. I now find myself trying not to worry about such typical things, finances, my job, whether I am being a good husband or father, whether I am following the path God wants me to be on. It is a joy to me that I have completed my studies, they were becoming quite a burden in the end, forcing me to spend my evenings completing assignments on subjects I cared nothing about. Now there is some room at least to breathe and dream, to spend unborrowed time with my darling ones and enjoy exploring other avenues of life. </p>
<p>Overall I am the most content now that I have ever been. God has richly blessed me with so much, a loving wife &amp; daughter, friends &amp; family, a home, a church family, a good job, perfect health, the list goes on. Though I continue to pray and seek for help with this thorn in my side, the tendancy to find myself anxious and battling feelings of being overwhelmed, I am also able to cope with much more than I ever have before. The levels of responsibility I find myself facing lead me to new concerns, new challenges, but I know that even just a few years ago I would never have been able to face them the way I can now. </p>
